	346	Apr 30 13:49	Apr 30 13:49	Updating A_timerinterrupt - Adding one more if condition - we'll stop the timer, if windowfirst != windowlast
	345	Apr 30 13:46	Apr 30 13:46	Updating A_timerinterrupt - Adding an if condition - we'll restart the timer when i == windowfirst
	344	Apr 30 13:42	Apr 30 13:42	Updating A_timerinterrupt - Sending the entire packet window at timeout/after timeout
	343	Apr 30 13:18	Apr 30 13:18	Bug Fixed - Forget to initialize variable i to 0 - solved
	342	Apr 30 13:14	Apr 30 13:13	Bug Fixed - Forget to add % Windowsize while updating windowFirst - Solved
	341	Apr 30 13:11	Apr 30 13:11	Handling for Commulative ACK - ACKing all the packets before receiving them in A_Input
	340	Apr 30 12:44	Apr 30 12:44	Bug Fixed - Updating the expected seqNum - Input_B function
	339	Apr 30 06:57	Apr 30 06:56	Changing the condition in A_input - Added and logic with condition
	338	Apr 30 06:43	Apr 30 06:43	Bug Fixed - Compilation Error - Missing Bracket - Solved

	334	Apr 30 06:03	Apr 30 06:02	Updating the nextseqNum in A_Output to get the seqNum
	333	Apr 30 05:51	Apr 30 05:51	Bug Fixed - Logic Error - Changed condition to windowcount > 0 which means if there will be any packets in the window, timer will start - Solved
	332	Apr 30 05:26	Apr 30 05:26	Bug Fixed - Compilation Error - Missing ; - Solved
	331	Apr 30 05:24	Apr 30 05:23	Updating on A_Input - If there will be any packets remaining to be ACKed by the reciever, this will stop the timer first, then check for condition and if true it will restart the timer otherwise it will be stop.

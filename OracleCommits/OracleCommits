	319	Apr 29 04:11	Apr 29 04:11	Bug Fixing - We add additional and logic condition to see wether there are any more packets left to be ACKed

	317	Apr 29 04:04	Apr 29 04:04	Updating the condition from True to given condition - To check whether ACk is previous seqNum or currenr seqNum
	316	Apr 29 03:48	Apr 29 03:48	Bug Fixing - Receiver was expecting seqNum 1, while sender was sending 0, so we changed expected seqNum to 0
	315	Apr 29 03:45	Apr 29 03:45	Updating altbit.c - three changes -1- when timer starts messages will be send from A to B -2- When ACK arrives to A, the timer will be then stopped -3- When packet will be resend because of timeout, we then again start the timer.
